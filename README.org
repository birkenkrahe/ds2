  "It is clear from the rising interest in statistics over calculus
  that 'data wrangling' is a growing field. But what happens when
  people just feed giant piles of data into fancy programs that those
  same people don't intimately understand? One possibility is that
  they generate interesting-looking but meaningless or incorrect
  results. For example, a recent study [...] showed that one-fifth of
  published genetics papers have errors due to improper spreadsheet
  usage. Getting it right is crucial when people's lives are
  affected."[fn:2] (Steinhart, 2019).

[fn:2]A timely comment! The problem could be systemic:
#+begin_quote
"The image of scientists as objective seekers of truth is periodically
jeopardized by the discovery of a major scientific fraud. [...]
Scientific results can be distorted in several ways, which can often
be very subtle and/or elude researchers' conscious control. Data, for
example, can be “cooked” (a process which mathematician Charles
Babbage in 1830 defined as “an art of various forms, the object of
which is to give to ordinary observations the appearance and character
of those of the highest degree of accuracy”[12]); it can be “mined” to
find a statistically significant relationship that is then presented
as the original target of the study; it can be selectively published
only when it supports one's expectations; it can conceal conflicts of
interest, etc." (Fanelli, 2009).
