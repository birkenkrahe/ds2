#+begin_quote
- Last DSC 205 course in spring'22 was too "tidy"[fn:2]
- Mixture of DataCamp lessons and current topics
- Learn R programming (functions, conditions, loops, utilities)
- Improve performance (e.g. ~data.table~, fast reading/writing)
- Special data science topics (e.g. NLP, ML, projects)
- Transcend R programming (e.g. command line data science)

[[../img/0_test.jpg]]

- The first DataCamp home assignment is due on January 20. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)

- The first in-class assignment is due on January 20. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)

- We'll write the first weekly multiple-choice test on January 20,
  covering all of the material that was covered until then.

* What should we do as a project?

[[../img/0_chatgpt.png]]

- For your term project, *pick an R package* to explore and explain
- The exploration should include *examples and tests*
- Your final deliverable should be a *literate program* (Org-mode)
- The final presentation should include *exercises* for the audience
- We can only accommodate *four (4) projects* altogether
- You need to deliver:
  a proposal, a literature review, an abstract

* What are you looking forward to?
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+attr_latex: :width 250px

- Developing lectures and exercises away from DataCamp
- Learning more about R packages through your projects
- Having fun with R programming and real applications

* Footnotes
[fn:2]My view towards the "Tidyverse" is well summarized in Matloff's
essay "[[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][TidyverseSceptic]]" (Matloff, 2022).

[fn:1]Maps and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are super cool but
deserve an introductory course on their own. The focus of my teaching
is to get you practical experience that you can use on the job instead
of a broad conceptual overview (though the latter would be easier for
all of us).
