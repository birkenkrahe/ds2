#+begin_quote
- Last DSC 205 course in spring'22 was too "tidy"[fn:2]
- Mixture of DataCamp lessons and current topics
- Learn R programming (functions, conditions, loops, utilities)
- Improve performance (e.g. ~data.table~, fast reading/writing)
- Special data science topics (e.g. NLP, ML, projects)
- Transcend R programming (e.g. command line data science)

- You find the invitation link to the group for Spring 23 [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1041/pages/course-links][in Canvas]].
- You will automatically be subscribed to the DSC 205 team
- If you are in more than one course, I will add you later manually
- These accounts will be valid until July 8, 2023 only

* When is the first assignment due?
#+attr_html: :width 300px
#+attr_latex: :width 300px
[[../img/0_test.jpg]]

- The first DataCamp home assignment is due on Friday, January 20. For
  late submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10).

- The first in-class assignment is due on Friday, January 20. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)

- We'll write the first weekly multiple-choice test on January 20,
  covering all of the material that was covered until then.

* What should we do as a project?

#+caption: R packages suitable for student projects by ChatGPT
[[../img/0_chatgpt.png]]

- For your term project, *pick an R package* to explore and explain

- The exploration should include *examples and tests*

- Your final deliverable should be a *literate program* (Org-mode)

- The final presentation should include *exercises* for the audience

- We can only accommodate *four (4) projects* altogether (groups of 3)

- Deliverables: proposal, literature review, abstract, Org-mode file

* Don't be fooled by ChatGPT

- Developing lectures and exercises beyond the "Tidyverse"
- Learning more about R packages through your projects
- Having fun with R programming and real applications
- Graphics compilation in a short time
- Another tool under (better: on) your belt
- I want the data science minor and the skills
- Learn more about the functional aspects of R
- Excited to use Emacs!
- The projects!
- I learn better when I get to work hands-on
- Close to work environment
- I want to see how far I can take R

* Footnotes
[fn:2]My view towards the "Tidyverse" is well summarized in Matloff's
essay "[[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][TidyverseSceptic]]" (Matloff, 2022).

[fn:1]Maps and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are super cool but
deserve an introductory course on their own. The focus of my teaching
is to get you practical experience that you can use on the job instead
of a broad conceptual overview (though the latter would be easier for
all of us).
