2) If you do not have any experience with Emacs, work through the
   *online tutorial* (open it in Emacs with ~CTRL + h t~) - ca. 1 hour.
   - Learn to open/close the editor
   - Learn basic cursor control (moving around)
   - Learn basic file management (open/close/find/save files)
   - Learn basic windows (buffer) management

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Maps and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are super cool but
deserve an introductory course on their own. The focus of my teaching
is to get you practical experience that you can use on the job instead
of a broad conceptual overview (though the latter would be easier for
all of us).
