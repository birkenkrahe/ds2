Short introduction to doing data science on the command line:
- What is the command line?
- Why use the command line for data science?
- How to get a command line that works for data science?
- Downloading data with ~curl~ and ~wget~
- *Regular expression primer*
- Cleaning data on the command line
- Database operations on the command line
- Introduction to the ~csvkit~ toolkit (Python)
- Introduction to the ~xsv~ toolkit (Rust)
- Practice with Linux (DataCamp workspaces)

- The source for this chapter is Fox, 2017 but there are many good
  books and tutorials, e,g, at [[https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorialcnt.html][regular-expressions.info]].

* Regular expressions
#+attr_latex: :width 400px

- Regular expressions (/regex/ or /regexp/) are useful in extracting
  information from any text by pattern searching (with a function)

- Applications include: validation, parsing/replacing strings, format
  transformations, web scraping

- Once you've learnt this tool, you can use it in all programming
  languages with (usually) very little changes if any at all

- In data science for transformations and for SQL queries, regexp are
  absolute life savers (I use them e.g. to play through DataCamp)

- We're going to look at some examples using Emacs' Unix emulation in
  the ~*eshell*~ (open with ~M-x eshell~).

- Even better: get Ubuntu (on Windows check Microsoft store, or on a
  Chromebook with the developers' settings).

- [[https://libguides.lib.fit.edu/ld.php?content_id=50509658][This cheat sheet]] for string manipulation with the R package ~stringr~
  contains a list of important regexp on the 2nd page.

* Overview of regex operators

- In this file, we'll discuss:
  1) Anchors ~^~ ~$~
  2) Quantifiers ~*~ ~+~ ~?~ ~{}~
  3) OR operator ~|~ or ~[]~
  4) Character classes ~\d~ ~\w~ ~\s~ ~.~
  5) Flags ~g~ ~m~ ~i~
  6) Grouping and capturing ~()~
  7) Bracket expressions ~[]~
  8) Greedy and lazy match ~*~ ~+~ ~{}~
  9) Boundaries ~\b~ ~\B~
  10) Back references ~\1~
  11) Look-ahead and look-behind ~(?=)~ ~(?<=)~ ~(?!)~

* Anchors ~^~ ~$~

- The caret ~^~ matches any string that starts with its RHS operand:
  #+begin_src sh
    ls | grep '^2'   # find all files starting with 2
  #+end_src

- Why are we using ~'~ instead of ~"~ - the shell expands any variables or
  special characters bounded by ~"~ while ~'~ is treated like a /literal/.

- Let's create a text vector to work with: instead of Cicero's /Lorem
  Ipsum/, we use the beginning of St Augustine's /Confessiones/ ([[https://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/latinconf/1.html][Source]]):
  #+begin_src R
    foo <- c("Magnus es, domine, et laudabilis valde: magna virtus tua, et sapientiae tuae non est numerus. et laudare te vult homo, aliqua portio creaturae tuae, et homo circumferens mortalitem suam, circumferens testimonium peccati sui et testimonium, quia superbis resistis: et tamen laudare te vult homo, aliqua portio creaturae tuae.tu excitas, ut laudare te delectet, quia fecisti nos ad te et inquietum est cor nostrum, donec requiescat in te. da mihi, domine, scire et intellegere, utrum sit prius invocare te an laudare te, et scire te prius sit an invocare te. sed quis te invocat nesciens te? aliud enim pro alio potest invocare nesciens. an potius invocaris, ut sciaris? quomodo autem invocabunt, in quem non crediderunt? aut quomodo credent sine praedicante? et laudabunt dominum qui requirunt eum. quaerentes enim inveniunt eum et invenientes laudabunt eum. quaeram te, domine, invocans te, et invocem te credens in te: praedicatus enim es nobis. invocat te, domine, fides mea, quam dedisti mihi, quam inspirasti mihi per humanitatem filii tui, per ministerium praedicatoris tui.")
    nchar(foo)
  #+end_src

- You can also get this from GitHub with ~curl~ on the command line or
  inside Emacs with ~M-x eww~: https://bit.ly/foo_text
  #+begin_src R
    shell("curl -o quote \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/ds2/main/org/foo.txt\"")
    shell("ls -la quote")
  #+end_src
  
- If you downloaded it you need to import it to R:
  #+begin_src R
    foo <- readLines("quote")
    str(foo)
  #+end_src

- Let's remove punctuation:
  #+begin_src R
    library(tm)
    removePunctuation(foo) -> foo
    foo
  #+end_src

- Then we're going to tokenize the string splitting it into its
  individual words with ~strsplit~, ~unlist~, and save the result in ~bar~:
  #+begin_src R
    strsplit(foo,split=" ") -> bar  ## split by spaces
    unlist(bar) -> bar
    length(bar)  ## how many words have we got?
    sum(nchar(bar)) ## how many characters have we retained?
  #+end_src

- Find all words beginning with specific letter:
  #+begin_src R
    x <- grep(pattern='^m',bar) ## finds all words beginning with 'm'
    bar[x]
  #+end_src

- In ~bash(1)~, the ~$~ matches a string that ends with its LHS operand:
  #+begin_src sh
    ls | grep '.org$' | wc -l   ## files ending with .org
  #+end_src

- We could also run this from within R (but without ~' '~):
  #+begin_src R
    shell("ls | grep .org$ | wc -l")
  #+end_src

- Which words in ~bar~ are ending in ~-ium~?
  #+begin_src R
    bar[grep(pattern='ium$',bar)]
  #+end_src

- Let's 1) remove all punctuation and save ~foo~ and ~bar~ to text files
  for later on:
  #+begin_src R
    library(tm)
    write(foo,"foo.txt")
    write(bar,"bar.txt")
    shell("ls foo.txt bar.txt")
  #+end_src

* Quantifiers ~*~ ~+~ ~?~ ~{}~

- ~abc*~ matches a string that has ~ab~ followed by zero or more ~c~:
  #+begin_src R
    ## all words with 'cre' followed by zero or more 'a'
    shell("cat bar.txt | grep crea*")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : STDIN
  : creaturae
  : creaturae
  : crediderunt
  : credent
  : credens

- ~abc+~ matches a string that has ~ab~ followed by one or more ~c~:
  #+begin_src R
    ## all words with 'cre' followed by one or more 'a'
    shell("cat bar.txt | grep crea+") 
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : STDIN
  : creaturae
  : creaturae
  
- ~abc?~ matches a string that has ~ab~ followed by zero or one ~c~:
  #+begin_src R
    ## all words with 'su' followed by zero or one 'a'
    shell("cat bar.txt | grep sua?") 
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : STDIN
  : suam
  : sui
  : superbis

- ~abc{2}~ matches a string that has ~ab~ followed by 2 ~c~:
   
- ~abc{2,}~ matches a string that has ~ab~ followed by 2 or more ~c~

- ~abc{2,5}~ matches a string that has ~ab~ followed by 2 up to 5 ~c~

- ~a(bc)*~ matches a string that has ~a~ followed by zero or more ~bc~

- ~a(bc){2,5}~ matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 ~bc~

* TODO OR operator ~|~ or ~[]~

- ~a(b|c)~ matches a string that has ~a~ followed by ~b~ or ~c~ and captures ~b~
  or ~c~
- ~a[bc]~ same as previous, but without capturing ~b~ or ~c~

* TODO Character classes ~\d~ ~\w~ ~\s~ ~.~

- ~\d~ matches a single character that is a digit
- ~\w~ matches a word character (alphanumeric character plus underscore)
- ~\s~ matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks)
- ~.~ matches any character

- Upper case commands ~\D~, ~\W~ and ~\S~ present their negations - inverse
  match

- In order to be taken literally, you must escape the characters
  ~^.[$()|*+?{\~ with a backslash ~\~ as they have special meaning,
  e.g. ~\$\d~ matches a string that has a ~$~ before one digit

- Notice that you can match also non-printable characters like tabs
  ~\t~, new-lines ~\n~, carriage returns ~\r~.
  
* TODO Flags ~g~ ~m~ ~i~

- A regex usually comes within this form ~/abc/~, where the search
  pattern is delimited by two slash characters ~/~. At the end we can
  specify a flag with these values (we can also combine them each
  other):

- ~g~ (global) does not return after the first match, restarting the
  subsequent searches from the end of the previous match
- ~m~ (multi-line) when enabled ~^~ and ~$~ will match the start and end of
  a line, instead of the whole string
- ~i~ (insensitive) makes the whole expression case-insensitive (for
  instance ~/aBc/i~ would match ~AbC~)

* TODO Advanced topics:
** Grouping and capturing ~()~
** Bracket expressions ~[]~
** Greedy and lazy match ~*~ ~+~ ~{}~
** Boundaries ~\b~ ~\B~
** Back references ~\1~
** Look-ahead and look-behind ~(?=)~ ~(?<=)~ ~(?!)~
