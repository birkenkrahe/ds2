You will learn:

- [ ] How variable names are compartmentalized in R
- [ ] What the rules for naming arguments and objects are
- [ ] How R searches for arguments and variables
- [ ] How you can specify arguments when calling a function

* Scoping

- Scoping rules determine how R stores and retrieves objects

- Applied e.g. when handling duplicate object names

- Example: ~data~ as an argument, and as a function -
  1) create a row-wise 3x3 matrix of numbers {1..9}
  2) list all datasets in ~ToothGrowth~
  #+begin_src R
    matrix(data=1:9, nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
    data(ToothGrowth)
  #+end_src

* Environments

- R enforces scoping rules with virtual /environment/

- An environment is a separate compartment for data structures (like
  vectors) and functions (like ~data~).

- Environments are /dynamic/ - they can be created, manipulated and
  removed.

- Technically, an environment is a pointer to the memory location
  where the R objects are stored.

- There are three types of environments:
  1) Global environments
  2) Package environments and namespaces
  3) Local or lexical environments

* Global environments

- Every object you've created or overwritten resides in the global
  environment of your R session.

- A call to ~ls()~ lists all objects, variables, and user-defined
  functions in the global environment

- Example: create three new objects and confirm their existence in the
  global environment:
  #+begin_src R
    foo <- 4 + 5
    bar <- "stringtastic"
    hello <- function() print("hello")
    ls()
    hello()
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] "bar"   "foo"   "hello"
  : [1] "hello"
  
* Package environments and namespaces

- Package environments are items made available by each package in R.

- You can use ~ls~ to list the items in a package environment: for
  example, to list the content of built-in  ~datasets~ (no functions)
  #+begin_src R
    ls("package:datasets")
  #+end_src
  Or to list the visible objects of the ~graphics~ package:
  #+begin_src R
    ls("package:graphics")
  #+end_src
  
- A package /namespace/ allows the package writer to hide functions and
  data that are only for internal use, and stops functions from
  breaking when a user or another package writer uses a duplicate
  name.

- As an example, load (after installation) the ~dplyr~ package (don't
  print the content - it has 300 functions!) and run ~dplyr::filter~. 
  #+begin_src R
    library(dplyr)
    dplyr::filter
  #+end_src

- If you look at the output (the definition of ~filter~ in this package,
  you notice an internal (~base~) function, ~UseMethod~, which is not
  listed in the visible content of ~dplyr~, and the name of the
  ~namespace~ environment.

- When loading ~dplyr~, you were informed that ~dplyr::filter~ masks
  another function, ~stats::filter~. This means that using ~filter~
  without the namespace reverts to ~dplyr::filter~. If you want to use
  the function of the same name in ~stats~, you need to call
  ~stats::filter~.
  
* Local or lexical environments

- Each time a function is called, a new environment called /local/ or
  /lexical/ is created.

- It contains all objects and variables created in and visible to the
  function, including any arguments you've supplied during execution.

- Example: call ~matrix~ and pass in the argument data:
  #+begin_src R
    youthspeak <- matrix(data = c("OMG", "LOL", "WTF", "YOLO"),
                         nrow=2, ncol=2)
    youthspeak
  #+end_src

- Calling ~matrix~ like this creates a local environment containing the
  ~data~ vector 
  
- When you execute the function, it begins by looking for ~data~ in this
  local environment. It is not confused by other objects named ~data~,
  such as ~utils::data~.

- If a required item is not found in the local environment, R does
  begin to widen its search.

- Once the function has completed, the local environment is
  automatically removed. The same goes for ~nrow~ and ~ncol~.

* Search Path

- To access data structures and functions other than the immediate
  global environment (of user-created objects), R follows a /search
  path/.

- You can view the search path with ~search()~:
  #+begin_src R
    search()
  #+end_src

- The path always begins at ~.GlobalEnv~ and ends after ~base~. It stops
  if an object is found in any environment along the path.

- If it does not find what it wanted, the /empty environment/ is
  reached.

- Example: let's see what happens when we create a vector with ~seq~:
  #+begin_src R
    baz <- seq(from=0, to=3, length.out=5)
    baz
  #+end_src
  
- R searches ~.GlobalEnv~ for ~seq~, goes through the list and finds it in
  ~base~. ~seq~ is executed and ~baz~ is created in the global environment.

- In the subsequent call to ~baz~, R finds it immediately in ~.GlobalEnv~.

- You can look up the environment of any function using ~environment~:
  #+begin_src R
    environment(seq)
    environment(abline)
    environment(filter)
  #+end_src
  
- When a package is loaded with ~library~, it is inserted in the search
  path right after the global environment, along with all its
  dependencies:
  #+begin_src R
    library('car')
    search()
  #+end_src

- In the example, loading ~car~ lead to the inclusion of the function
  package and its accompanying dataset package: do you remember how to
  list the contents of ~carData~?
  #+begin_src R
    ls('package:carData')
  #+end_src

- An error is thrown if you request a function or object
  + that you haven't *defined*,
  + that doesn't *exist*,
  + that is in a contributed package that you've forgotten to *load*
  #+begin_src R
    neither.here()  # undefined function
    nor.there       # undefined object
  #+end_src
