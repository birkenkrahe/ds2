- This BONUS PROBLEM file accompanies the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds2/blob/main/org/3_conditions.org][lecture]] on conditional
  statements.
- Complete and submit the completed Org-mode file in Canvas
- Bonus points contribute to your final grade as "home assignments"
- The "literate quality" of the submission will count for your final
  points

* TODO Identify and pledge yourself

1) In Emacs, replace the placeholder ~[yourname]~ at the top of this
   file by your own name and write ~(pledged)~ next to it
2) Go with the cursor on the headline and hange the ~TODO~ label to ~DONE~
   by entering ~S-<right>~ ("Shift + right-arrow").

* Problem

Write R code that takes a square ~character~ matrix and checks if any of
the character strings on the diagonal (top left to bottom right)
begin with the letter ~g~, lowercase or uppercase.

If satisfied, overwrite these specific entries with the string ~"HERE"~.
Otherwise, the entire matrix should be replaced with an identity
matrix of the same dimensions (all diagonal entries are ~1~).

/Tip:/ You can use the functions ~which~, ~diag~ and ~substr~.

* TODO Solution

#+begin_src R

#+end_src

* TODO Test your solution

Try your code on the following matrices, checking the result each
time:
#+begin_example R
  mymat1 <- matrix(as.character(1:16),4,4)
  mymat2 <- matrix(c("DANDELION","Hyacinthus","Gerbera","MARIGOLD",
                     "geranium","ligularia","Pachysandra","SNAPDRAGON",
                     "GLADIOLUS"),3,3)
  mymat3 <- matrix(c("GREAT", "exercises", "right", "here"),2,2,byrow=T)
#+end_example
