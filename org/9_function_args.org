- Watch: [[https://youtu.be/ohDB5gbtaEQ]["The Argument" by Monty Python]] (the British comedy group that
  gave the "Python" programming language its name).

- The English word 'argument' comes from Latin /argumentum/ for /make
  clear, prove, accuse/, and stands for any 'process of reasoning'[fn:1].

- Here: default arguments, missing argument values, and passing extra
  arguments using ellipses (...)

[fn:1] Since I'm writing this lecture on the eve of the visit of the
"Pope's astronomer", Br. Guy Consolmagno, a Jesuit and astronomer to
Pope Francis (another Jesuit), I am reminded of the reputation of
Jesuits for being great at arguing - something you could see in the
Q&A session after Gr. Guy's talk on "Astronomy, Religion and the Art
of Storytelling". One could argue that any story contains at least one
argument (a complete process of reasoning), and that the best
arguments are constructed like stories (remember the Freytag curve,
which I've also used in my paper on scientific storytelling).
