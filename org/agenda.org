*Familiarize yourself with ChatGPT (and CoPilot):*
1. Large language models will transform coding workflows
2. Generative AI will transform content creation and generation
3. AI will fuel productivity increases across a range of professions

*Invest in Literate programming:*
1. Next generation of notebooks closer to low-code data products
2. Increased focus on model explainability and data ethics

*Learn to control the infrastructure:*
1. Data observability drives trust in data / accelerates data culture
2. Innovation in tooling puts conceptual knowledge at the center

*Think a little more about your career options:*
1. Recession-proof industries safe haven for analytics professionals
2. Rise of specialist new roles signals a maturing role ecosystem
3. Organizations and institutions continue to invest in data literacy

* Week 3 - Argument matching

** TODO [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1041/assignments][Upload your practice files! (By Friday)]]
** DONE Condition for repeating tests

- If you inform me beforehand that you cannot attend an announced
  test, we can make arrangements for you to take the test outside of
  class.

** DONE Project - first sprint review (Monday, Feb 6)
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/sprint.png]]

- The term project purpose is the exploration of any R package or
  (linked) group of packages.

- There are many different ways to explore and/or document a package - e.g. succinct, verbose, opinionated, objective, accessible or not.

- Your first deliverable is a project proposal formatted as an
  Org-mode file. Here is a template for such a file with definitions.

  1) Meta data: preliminary title (~#+TITLE~), list of team members
     (~#+AUTHOR:~), course title (~#+SUBTITLE~).

  2) Headlines: ~Problem~, ~Reason~, ~Constraints~, ~Goals and Non-goals~,
     ~Metrics~, ~References~

     - *Problem*: describe the problem that you're trying to solve.

     - *Reason*: why is this problem interesting (to you) right now?

     - *Constraints:* which difficulties, e.g. technical or conceptual,
       do you foresee right now?

     - *Goals and non-goals*: list all goals that you might want to
       achieve with this project. Order the goals by importance. Add a
       list of non-goals, i.e. things that are outside the scope of
       your project.

     - *Metrics*: how would you measure the success of your project?

     - *References*: list any references that you found already. Make
       sure that they are consistent (same format) and complete
       (author, date, title, place).

- Upload your result to Canvas (*no later than Feb 6, 12 pm*). Missing
  the deadline will cost you points.

* Week 4: Conditional statements
** TODO Review: DataCamp lesson "Conditional statements"

- [ ] What's the result of using a relational operator in R?
- [ ] What's the result of using such an operator on a vector?
- [ ] What is ~foo==0~ if ~foo <- 1:10~ ? What is ~sum(foo==0)~?
  #+begin_src R
    foo <- 1:10
    foo
    foo==0
    sum(foo == 0)
  #+end_src
- [ ] What is ~foo[-10] < foo~?
  #+begin_src R :results output
    foo[-10] < foo
  #+end_src
- [ ] Can I write ~m < 4~ even if ~m~ is a ~matrix~?
  #+begin_src R  :results output
    matrix(1:9,nr=3,byrow=TRUE) < 4
  #+end_src
- [ ] Can I write ~m & 4~ even if ~m~ is a ~matrix~?
  #+begin_src R  :results output
    matrix(1:9,nr=3,byrow=TRUE) & 4
    TRUE & 4
    1 & 4
    0 & 4
  #+end_src
- [ ] What's the difference between ~|~ and ~||~?
  #+begin_src R :results output
    TRUE | FALSE
    c(TRUE,FALSE) | c(FALSE,FALSE)
    c(TRUE,FALSE) || c(FALSE,FALSE)
  #+end_src
- [ ] What's the problem with this code? (It should print "hello".)
  #+begin_src R
    x <- 0
    if (x=0) print("hello")
  #+end_src
- [ ] Why does this code print "ciao" but not "hello"?
  #+begin_src R
    x <- 1
    if (x < 2) {
      print ("ciao")
    } else if (x == 1) {
      print("hello")
    }
  #+end_src

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Topic: explore an R package; deliverables: proposal, literature
review, abstract, literate program, presentation.

[fn:2] ~:session~ starts an R console inside Emacs. It can be specified
at the start as a ~#+property~, or at the start of a code block on the
~#+begin_src~ headline.

[fn:3] The Global environment contains auto-loaded and user-defined
objects. Its contents are listed with ~ls()~ or ~ls('package:[name]')~.
