* Project - first sprint review (Monday, Feb 6)
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/sprint.png]]

- The term project purpose is the exploration of any R package or
  (linked) group of packages.

- There are many different ways to explore and/or document a package -
  e.g. succinct, verbose, opinionated, objective, accessible or not.

- Your first deliverable is a project proposal formatted as an
  Org-mode file. Here is a template for such a file with definitions.

  1) Meta data: preliminary title (~#+TITLE~), list of team members
     (~#+AUTHOR:~), course title (~#+SUBTITLE~).

  2) Headlines: ~Problem~, ~Reason~, ~Constraints~, ~Goals and Non-goals~,
     ~Metrics~, ~References~

     - *Problem*: describe the problem that you're trying to solve.

     - *Reason*: why is this problem interesting (to you) right now?

     - *Constraints:* which difficulties, e.g. technical or conceptual,
       do you foresee right now?

     - *Goals and non-goals*: list all goals that you might want to
       achieve with this project. Order the goals by importance. Add a
       list of non-goals, i.e. things that are outside the scope of
       your project.

     - *Metrics*: how would you measure the success of your project?

     - *References*: list any references that you found already. Make
       sure that they are consistent (same format) and complete
       (author, date, title, place).

- Upload your result to Canvas (*no later than Feb 6, 12 pm*). Missing
  the deadline will cost you points.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Topic: explore an R package; deliverables: proposal, literature
review, abstract, literate program, presentation.

[fn:2] ~:session~ starts an R console inside Emacs. It can be specified
at the start as a ~#+property~, or at the start of a code block on the
~#+begin_src~ headline.

[fn:3] The Global environment contains auto-loaded and user-defined
objects. Its contents are listed with ~ls()~ or ~ls('package:[name]')~.
