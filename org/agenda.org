** DONE Project - first sprint review (Monday, Feb 6)
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/sprint.png]]

  - The term project purpose is the exploration of any R package or
    (linked) group of packages.

  - There are many different ways to explore and/or document a package - e.g. succinct, verbose, opinionated, objective, accessible or not.

  - Your first deliverable is a project proposal formatted as an
    Org-mode file. Here is a template for such a file with definitions.

    1) Meta data: preliminary title (~#+TITLE~), list of team members
       (~#+AUTHOR:~), course title (~#+SUBTITLE~).

    2) Headlines: ~Problem~, ~Reason~, ~Constraints~, ~Goals and Non-goals~,
       ~Metrics~, ~References~

       - *Problem*: describe the problem that you're trying to solve.

       - *Reason*: why is this problem interesting (to you) right now?

       - *Constraints:* which difficulties, e.g. technical or conceptual,
         do you foresee right now?

       - *Goals and non-goals*: list all goals that you might want to
         achieve with this project. Order the goals by importance. Add a
         list of non-goals, i.e. things that are outside the scope of
         your project.

       - *Metrics*: how would you measure the success of your project?

       - *References*: list any references that you found already. Make
         sure that they are consistent (same format) and complete
         (author, date, title, place).

  - Upload your result to Canvas (*no later than Feb 6, 12 pm*). Missing
    the deadline will cost you points.

** DONE Get bonus points when practicing

#+attr_latex: :width 200px
[[../img/datacamp2.png]]
- You can get 10 bonus points if you keep a practice streak of 10 days
- You can do this up to 3 times for a maximum of 30 points, which will
  be applied to your weakest final grade category
- Submit a screenshot of your mobile (or desktop) streak in Canvas 
- If you lose your streak between day 5 and 10, you still get 5 points
- On the dashboard, DataCamp will suggest practice categories for you,
  and also in the mobile app
- This option ends on May 3rd (last day of spring term)
- You can get this bonus only in one of my courses (if you attend > 1)
#+attr_latex: :width 400p
[[../img/datacamp3.png]]

** DONE GNU Treats: ~speed-type~, ~treemacs~ and ~gtypist~

- An attractive alternative to ~Dired~ is the ~treemacs~ package. It
  looks like this on my PC (and also works for the terminal Emacs):
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/t_treemacs.png]]

- If you want to be faster on the keyboard, try [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gtypist/gtypist.html#:~:text=GNU%20Typist%20(also%20called%20gtypist,the%20GNU%20General%20Public%20License.][GNU Typist]], a free
  10-lesson online trainer for increasing your typing skills.
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/gtypist.png]]

- There is also an Emacs package to practice touch/speed typing in
  Emacs called ~speed-type~. You have to install it with ~M-x
  package-list-packages~, then find the package in the list and install
  with ~i~ and ~x~. [[https://github.com/dakra/speed-type][More information on GitHub.]]
    
* Week 6: Bonus review, coding loops
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/5_loop.jpg]]

- [X] Projects 2nd sprint review looming (March 10)
- [X] How to reference and document coding support by AI
- [ ] Coding loops: ~for~, ~while~, ~apply~, ~repeat~
- [ ] Lectures and exercises
- [ ] Bonus exercises for extra credit: ~for~, ~while~

** DONE Assignments with an AI "wingbot"
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/3_bonus_bot.png]]

- If you use AI to solve problems, you need to document that you
  struggled with the problem yourself so that it is clear that the AI
  was a last resort or really just a "helper", and not God.

- To do this, don't delete failed attempts, and demonstrate that you
  tested the AIs answer thoroughly.

- Also, you must cite it as a reference (complete and consistent)

** DONE Projects: 2nd sprint review
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/sprint.png]]

- Deadline for 2nd sprint review: Friday, March 10, 1 pm
- To do: literature review (you'll get a template from me)
- Feedback for each team submitted via Email (PDF from Org-mode)

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Topic: explore an R package; deliverables: proposal, literature
review, abstract, literate program, presentation.

[fn:2] ~:session~ starts an R console inside Emacs. It can be specified
at the start as a ~#+property~, or at the start of a code block on the
~#+begin_src~ headline.

[fn:3] The Global environment contains auto-loaded and user-defined
objects. Its contents are listed with ~ls()~ or ~ls('package:[name]')~.
