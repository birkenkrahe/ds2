** Objectives

   For those who took DSC 101 in fall 2021 (data science tools and
   methods), this course continues the journey into data science using
   the functional programming language R. The focus of this advanced
   introduction is data exploration, with excursions into data
   wrangling, programming, and modeling using R. However, this is not
   an R course, but a course on exploring data. In contrast to DSC
   101, we will be using both the "Tidyverse" methodology, and IDEs
   (Rstudio, Emacs). You will practice using classroom assignments and
   weekly programming assignments in DataCamp[fn:2]. See prerequisites
   below.

** Student learning outcomes

   Students who complete dsc 205, "advanced introduction to data
   science", will be able to:

   * Import data into R, store them, and transform them for analysis
   * Visualize data as part of advanced explorative data analysis
   * Understand basic predictive modeling strategies and methods
   * Master statistical programming in R using the "Tidyverse" package
   * Master the infrastructure for advanced statistical computing
   * Know how to effectively present assignment results

** Course requirements

   To join this course without having completed DSC 101, complete the
   DataCamp courses "Datascience for Everyone", and "Introduction to
   R", and pass the entry quiz in week 1 of the course (with > 50%).
   
   Some knowledge of, and experience with computers is useful but not
   critical. Curiosity and discipline are essential. You will gain
   data literacy skills by taking this course. The course will prepare
   you for further studies in computer and data science, or in other
   disciplines that use modern computing, i.e. every discipline, from
   accounting to zoology).

* STANDARD POLICIES[fn:4]
** HONOR CODE

   ALL GRADED WORK IN THIS CLASS IS TO BE PLEDGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
   THE LYON COLLEGE HONOR CODE. THE USE OF A PHONE FOR ANY REASON
   DURING THE COURSE OF AN EXAM IS CONSIDERED AN HONOR CODE
   VIOLATION.

** CLASS ATTENDANCE POLICY

   STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND ALL CLASS PERIODS FOR THE COURSES
   IN WHICH THEY ARE ENROLLED. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONFERRING
   WITH INDIVIDUAL PROFESSORS REGARDING ANY MISSED
   ASSIGNMENTS. FACULTY MEMBERS ARE TO NOTIFY THE REGISTRAR WHEN A
   STUDENT MISSES THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE, TWO, THREE, AND FOUR WEEKS
   OF CLASS PERIODS IN A SINGLE COURSE. UNDER THIS POLICY, THERE IS
   NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN “EXCUSED” AND “UNEXCUSED” ABSENCES, EXCEPT
   THAT A STUDENT MAY MAKE UP WORK MISSED DURING AN EXCUSED
   ABSENCE. A REMINDER OF THE COLLEGE’S ATTENDANCE POLICY WILL BE
   ISSUED TO THE STUDENT AT ONE WEEK, A SECOND REMINDER AT TWO WEEKS,
   A WARNING AT THREE WEEKS, AND NOTIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE
   WITHDRAWAL AND THE ASSIGNING OF AN “F” GRADE AT FOUR
   WEEKS. STUDENTS WHO ARE ADMINISTRATIVELY WITHDRAWN FROM MORE THAN
   ONE COURSE WILL BE PLACED ON PROBATION OR SUSPENDED.

** DISABILITIES

   STUDENTS SEEKING REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS BASED ON DOCUMENTED
   LEARNING DISABILITIES MUST CONTACT INTERIM DIRECTOR OF ACADEMIC
   SUPPORT COURTNEY BEAL IN THE MORROW ACADEMIC CENTER AT (870)
   307-7016 OR AT COURTNEY.BEAL@LYON.EDU.

* COURSE SPECIFIC INFORMATION
** ASSIGNMENTS AND HONOR CODE[fn:5]

   THERE WILL BE NUMEROUS ASSIGNMENTS DURING THE SEMESTER - E.G.
   PROGRAMMING, LESSONS, TESTS, AND SPRINT REVIEWS. THEY ARE DUE AT
   THE BEGINNING OF THE CLASS PERIOD ON THE DUE DATE. ONCE CLASS
   BEGINS, THE ASSIGMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED ONE DAY LATE IF IT HAS NOT
   BEEN TURNED IN.  LATE PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT AN
   EXTENSION. EXTENSIONS WILL *NOT* BE GRANTED FOR REASONS SUCH AS:

   * YOU COULD NOT GET TO A COMPUTER
   * YOU COULD NOT GET A COMPUTER TO DO WHAT YOU WANTED IT TO DO
   * THE NETWORK WAS DOWN
   * THE PRINTER WAS OUT OF PAPER OR TONER
   * YOU ERASED YOUR FILES, LOST YOUR HOMEWORK, OR MISPLACED YOUR
     FLASH DRIVE
   * YOU HAD OTHER COURSEWORK OR FAMILY COMMITMENTS THAT INTERFERED
     WITH YOUR WORK IN THIS COURSE

   PUT “PLEDGED” AND A NOTE OF ANY COLLABORATION IN THE COMMENTS OF
   ANY PROGRAM YOU TURN IN. PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS ARE INDIVIDUAL
   EFFORTS, BUT YOU MAY SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM ANOTHER STUDENT OR THE
   COURSE INSTRUCTOR.  YOU MAY NOT COPY SOMEONE ELSE’S SOLUTION. IF
   YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE FINISHING AN ASSIGNMENT, IT IS FAR BETTER TO
   DO YOUR OWN WORK AND RECEIVE A LOW SCORE THAN TO GO THROUGH AN
   HONOR TRIAL AND SUFFER THE PENALTIES THAT MAY BE INVOLVED.

   WHAT IS CHEATING ON AN ASSIGNMENT? HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES:

   * HAVING SOMEONE ELSE WRITE YOUR ASSIGNMENT, IN WHOLE OR IN PART
   * COPYING AN ASSIGNMENT SOMEONE ELSE WROTE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART
   * COLLABORATING WITH SOMEONE ELSE TO THE EXTENT THAT YOUR
     SUBMISSIONS ARE IDENTIFIABLY VERY SIMILAR, IN WHOLE OR IN PART
   * TURNING IN A SUBMISSION WITH THE WRONG NAME ON IT

   WHAT IS NOT CHEATING?  HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES:

   * TALKING TO SOMEONE IN GENERAL TERMS ABOUT CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN AN
     ASSIGNMENT
   * ASKING SOMEONE FOR HELP WITH A SPECIFIC ERROR MESSAGE OR BUG IN
     YOUR PROGRAM
   * GETTING HELP WITH THE SPECIFICS OF LANGUAGE SYNTAX OR CITATION
     STYLE
   * UTILIZING INFORMATION GIVEN TO YOU BY THE INSTRUCTOR

   ANY ASSISTANCE MUST BE CLEARLY EXPLAINED IN THE COMMENTS AT THE
   BEGINNING OF YOUR SUBMISSION.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT
   THIS, PLEASE ASK OR REVIEW THE POLICIES RELATING TO THE HONOR CODE.

   ABSENCES ON DAYS OF EXAMS:

   TEST “MAKE-UPS” WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED IF ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN
   MADE PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED TIME.  IF YOU ARE SICK THE DAY OF THE
   TEST, PLEASE E-MAIL ME OR LEAVE A MESSAGE ON MY PHONE BEFORE THE
   SCHEDULED TIME, AND WE CAN MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WHEN YOU RETURN.

* FOOTNOTES

[fn:1]I could not settle on any particular textbook. I considered
several: R for Data Science by Grolemund/Wickham (2017), EDA using R
by Pearson, and the Art of R Programming by Matloff (2011). In the
end, I remembered the difficulties that many students had with
splitting their attention between datacamp assignments and classroom
lectures, and I decided to use lectures/lab to work through the
DataCamp material with you using my own interactive notebooks and
exercises.

[fn:2]the assignments cover three complete certificate courses that
you can readily add to your resume!

[fn:3]schedule may change depending on course load and progress.

[fn:4]sent by the interim provost, anthony grafton. updated jan 2022.

# 
[fn:5]Taken from David Sonnier with minor modifications.

[fn:6]Academic calendar sent by the Provost, Melissa Taverner.

[fn:7]Lab work includes classroom assignments in the form of
interactive notebooks, and deepening of the advanced DataCamp
material.

[fn:8]Some of the DataCamp assignments are heavily influenced by the
"Tidyverse" approach to data science with R as explained in "R for
Data Science" (r4ds) by [[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html][Grolemund/Wickham (2017)]].

[fn:9]Quiz: covers the material of the past week. Usually 5 min at the
beginning of class, multiple choice. Test: in class exercises.
