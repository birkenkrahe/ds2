#+begin_example
       Given that data science is one of the fastest growing fields in the
job market, it's very natural for students like ourselves to look into
it as a viable career choice. But when we say “data science” we tend
to ignore the fact that not all data science jobs are equal. As
diverse as data science is, there are many different ways to measure
the overall “success” of a data science job–and many different
variables that influence that success. In this project though, we are
just going to keep it simple, strictly looking at how several
different variables affect the overall pay of data science
jobs. Additionally, we will be using the R package ggvis to visualize
and explain our research.
       Let’s start with ggvis. Ggvis is a visualization package in R
that shares many features with ggplot2. In fact, much of the syntax
transfers between the two packages. Unlike ggplot2 though, ggvis
allows the use of shiny’s interface to create interactive and animated
graphics rendered in a web browser. Ultimately, the goal of ggvis was
to create a package that combined the utility of R, with the ease of
access of a browser.
       Moving onto our data specifically, we are looking at how five
different factors affect the salary of data science jobs. Firstly,
something that impacts most fields of work: experience level. For our
project, we divided experience level into four categories. Entry level
jobs, mid level jobs, high level jobs, and executive level jobs. And
as expected, generally the more experience you obtain, the more money
you earn. Entry level jobs start at about 60,000 dollars per year, and
there is a steady increase in average pay of about 50,000 dollars per
year, per level. Job titles are another factor that impacts most
fields–but it does not play as large a role in data science jobs as
you might think. Unlike most fields, jobs in data science tend to have
different titles for similar work. This is shown in our research, as
if you exclude executive level positions, there isn’t much correlation
between the average salary over job titles. Something we were very
surprised doesn’t have much of an impact on salary is the remote
ratio, or the proportion of the job that is done remotely.
Astonishingly, there is quite a large amount of variance over
all amounts of remoteness–and it’s not strictly better to be in
person or remote. The final two factors we are looking at in our
project are company size and location. We divided company size up into
three categories: small, medium, and large. This was one of the more
interesting factors in our opinion, as although the average pay among
sizes only slightly increased with company size, larger companies had
significantly higher average salaries involving high level and
executive level jobs. We divided location up by country, and location
behaved very predictably, as jobs in first world countries had higher
salaries than jobs in smaller countries.
       We are very excited to present our research in full, and
further explore ggvis with the class as a whole.
